# Question
## Assume you have a method `isSubstring()` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a **rotation** of `s1` using **only one call** to `isSubstring()`
>“waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”.  
Explain: "erbottle | wat" ---Rotate--> "wat | erbottle"

## Thinking
The question tells us only use `isSubstring()` once.
