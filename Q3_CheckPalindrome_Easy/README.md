# Given a string, write a function to check if it is palindrome or not.
> A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, “abba” is palindrome, but “abbc” is not palindrome.

## Examples:
1. Input: ABCDCBA
    * return: true
> If we read string from end to begin, it is same as begin to end.

2. Input: THISISNOTAPALINDROME
    * return: false
